      Opening an old repository feels like flipping through a forgotten journal. 
      Functions are written with a kind of urgency that belonged to a younger me, 
      one who believed elegance was the same thing as worth.  

      I can see in the indentation where I rushed, in the variable names where I dreamed. 
      A half-finished feature is not just technical debt, but a fossil of my distraction, 
      or perhaps my heartbreak that week.  

      Every developer, whether they admit it or not, leaves parts of themselves in the code. 
      Not just algorithms, but anxieties. Not just syntax, but longing.  

      And so, even when a project dies, fragments of me remain there—shadows I did not 
      intend to preserve. Maybe that’s what makes revisiting old code both painful and 
      strangely tender. I’m not just debugging programs; I’m debugging myself.`

      The moment after deployment is a peculiar kind of quiet.  
      You’ve typed \`git push\`, the logs have streamed by, and now you wait.  

      It’s not really about the code anymore—it’s about exposure. 
      Will the users see the update and feel nothing, or will they stumble 
      into a bug you missed?  

      In that pause, time stretches. My heartbeat sounds louder than the fan 
      of my machine. I am reminded that software is not a private act. 
      It is a conversation, whether I like it or not.  

      If things break, the silence ends with alerts, Slack messages, maybe even blame.  
      If things hold, the silence deepens into something else: a relief so gentle 
      it barely announces itself.  

      This is the rhythm of creation in code: the chaos of making, 
      the silence of waiting, the whisper of consequence.`

      Some systems feel like ruins—still standing, still functional, 
      but clearly belonging to another era.  
      Their patterns are archaic, their dependencies forgotten, 
      their documentation missing.  

      And yet, they work.  
      They carry the weight of countless transactions, decisions, lives.  

      When I step into these codebases, I feel like an archaeologist. 
      Every function call is an inscription. Every hack is a rumor.  
      I’ll never know the full story of the people who built them, 
      but I can sense their presence.  

      Maintenance is not just about keeping systems alive. 
      It’s about remembering that behind every enduring architecture 
      was once a mind trying to solve a problem.  

      To maintain is to honor. To rewrite is to mourn.`

      I have dozens of repositories that will never see another commit.  
      Some were prototypes, some were wild ideas, some were fragile bursts of hope.  

      They sit in my GitHub like little tombstones, each one a project 
      that carried me for a season and then let me go.  

      Sometimes I wonder: are these failures? Or are they simply traces 
      of growth—projects that taught me something before they became unnecessary?  

      Abandoned code is heavy because it mirrors the parts of ourselves 
      we’ve also abandoned. The dreams we had, the energy we’ve lost, 
      the illusions we’ve shed.  

      But maybe that’s what craft really is: not every seed growing into a tree, 
      but every attempt leaving behind something that shaped us, even in silence.`

      Most nights, I lose myself in code. The logic consumes me, 
      the puzzle distracts me, and the loneliness fades.  

      But not always.  

      Some nights the keystrokes sound hollow. The monitor feels cold. 
      The compiler cannot fix what is broken inside me.  

      I remind myself that being human is not a bug.  
      That emptiness, too, is part of the design.  

      And on those nights, I close the laptop not as a developer, 
      but as a person—one who needs silence, rest, 
      maybe even someone else’s presence more than another line of code.`

      The tech landscape is a storm of frameworks.  
      React gives way to Svelte, which gives way to the next thing.  
      Each promises to be the future, each gathers disciples, 
      and each eventually fades into the archive.  

      At first it feels exhausting—how can we ever keep up?  
      But beneath the churn, there are patterns.  
      Frameworks rise and fall, but the problems remain the same: 
      state, rendering, data flow, human comprehension.  

      What changes is the syntax, the packaging, the story we tell ourselves 
      about control.  

      The truth is, frameworks are less about technology 
      and more about our relationship with complexity.  
      They are mirrors of our desires: for order, for clarity, 
      for the illusion that we can outpace chaos.  

      The frameworks will keep coming. The patterns will remain.`

    title: "What Truly Is Love?",

What truly is love?  
Is love letting go, or is it fighting?  
Is it sometimes fighting and other times letting go?  
Is it about understanding that someone deserves better, and then "ghosting" them?  
Or is it about the time spent together, or the promise of "till death do us part"?  

Is love about being there for someone no matter what, or is it about knowing this person is wrong, and still standing by them?  
Is it about knowing someone is wrong, and because you can't stand the decision, you leave?  
Does love ever truly “finish,” or does it continue for eternity?  
Can love pretend for a very, very long time?  
Do I even understand what love really is?  

For the last seven years of my life, I have struggled with this thought process.  
In the end, how do you really know something is love?  
Not by the time, not the “feelings,” not even how much of friends we are.  
Is it by how much you cry when the person leaves?  

To be honest, I don’t think I will ever fully understand the feeling.  
I am just a man, and I am not even very good at being a man yet.  
I believe understanding quantum mechanics is easier than understanding the concept of human love.  

In the end, love is many things.  
Love is what carries people to fight wars.  
Love is what makes people poison others.  
Love is what makes people deceive each other.  
Love is sometimes translated as hatred.  

Freud saw love through a different lens — he coined the word *ambivalence*,  
trying to explain how we all have both love and hate towards the same person.  
So, in the end, hate (I am paraphrasing) is just the absence of love.  
In some sense, every single human emotion stems from the presence or absence of love.  

I don’t want to go into Friedrich (I think everyone knows how much I like him) — the “diagnostician of nihilism.”  
Though he never defined both as the same thing, in some contexts his writings (at least the ones I have read) point in that perspective.  

I have been very terrible at expressing love, but in a subtle way I think writing has been the way I’ve enjoyed expressing it — writing, and also occasionally other things 😂😂.  
I think love is about giving, giving in some form or another:  
giving your time, your emotions, your money 😂😂, no matter how little it might be.  

And today, I am expressing my love in a letter.  
So, this — this is to someone.  
Or is it?
